# Sparse-Matrix-Formative
This repository contains a concise Python implementation of a Sparse Matrix data structure and basic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication). The code reads matrix data from a file, stores only nonzero entries for memory efficiency, and supports matrix operations with proper error handling.

Features:
- Sparse Representation: Uses a dictionary to store only nonzero elements.
- Matrix Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- File Input: Reads from files formatted as:
  rows=<number>
  cols=<number>
  (row, col, value)
  (row, col, value)
  ...
- Error Handling: Checks input format and raises errors if invalid.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Place your matrix input files in the designated folder (e.g., `sample_txts`).
3. Run the program with:
python3 main.py


You can follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and input the file paths.
